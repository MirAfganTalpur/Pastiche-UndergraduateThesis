## About
Pastiche is an Android app created for my undergraduate thesis at Ontario Tech Univeristy (formerly UOIT). Pastiche uses deep learning and allows users to merge the style of their favourite work of art to their pictures using a technique called neural style transfer. Pastiche also allows you to choose where you want the art style applied. It's as easy as finger painting! Enjoy.
